# R-Examples
My R Script examples

I'm a **newbie** to R. I needed a better tool then Excel to plot my data, found R and liked it. These are simple code chunks that you can use on your R Scripts. This is much a work in progress so feel free to ask anything.

## Plot Tribometer Data

I have a csv file that has tribometer data in it. This script imports csv files in a directory and generates data frames for them. After I use a moving average to filter the result and plot it. Script isn't automated yet, so help is needed.
