# R-Examples
My R Script examples

I'm a **newbie** to R. I needed a better tool then Excel to plot my data, found R and liked it. These are simple code chunks that you can use on your R Scripts. This is much a work in progress so feel free to ask anything.

## Plot Tribometer Data

I have a csv file that has tribometer data in it. This script imports csv files in a directory and generates data frames for them. After I use a moving average to filter the result and plot it. Script isn't automated yet, so help is needed.

## Surface Profile

This script gets surface profile data and finds peaks and calculates wear area. Imports and calculates area and plots for all *.csv files in working directory.
A sample report created using SurfaceProfile.R script is given at [Wear_Track_Analysis.pdf](https://github.com/gokcemay/R-Examples/blob/master/Wear_Track_Analysis.pdf), source file for that report is given as [Wear Track Analysis.Rmd](https://github.com/gokcemay/R-Examples/blob/master/Wear%20Track%20Analysis.Rmd)
